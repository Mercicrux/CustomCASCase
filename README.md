Hi!

This is a custom case for the Ti-Nspire CX CAS I (not II). It is largely unfinnished at the moment, but here are some notes about the current build:
1. The back cover is slightly taller than it should be, and the fillets on the bottom of it is off by a large amount. 
2. The cover for the charging port is fragile and brittle, I would recomend printing it with a 0.2mm nozzel and in a strong material.
3. The shells for the calculator are likely a long way off as they are very complex shapes, but if you want to help out, go ahead and try and make/fix any parts, it would be greatly appreciated.
